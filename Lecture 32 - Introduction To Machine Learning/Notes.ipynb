    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning** is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that gives computers the ability to **learn from data** and make **decisions or predictions** without being explicitly programmed for every task.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **In simple terms:** You feed data to a machine, and it learns patterns from that data to make predictions or decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to predict whether an email is **spam or not**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  You give the model **hundreds of emails** labeled as \"spam\" or \"not spam\".\n",
    "-  It **learns patterns** (e.g., spammy words like \"lottery\", \"free\", \"prize\").\n",
    "-  Then, it can predict whether **new emails** are spam or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is mainly divided into **three types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "You train the model using **labeled data** (data with answers).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Predicting house prices based on features like area, number of rooms, location, etc.\n",
    "-  Email spam detection (as explained above).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input → Features (e.g., area, rooms)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output → Labels (e.g., price)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Decision Trees\n",
    "- Random Forest\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "You train the model using **unlabeled data** (no output/answers provided). The model tries to find **patterns or groups**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grouping customers into segments based on their shopping behavior.\n",
    "- Detecting unusual behavior in network traffic (Anomaly Detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input → Just features, no labels\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* K-Means Clustering\n",
    "* Hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model learns by **trial and error**, like training a dog. It takes actions, receives **rewards or penalties**, and learns the best strategy over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Teaching a robot to walk.\n",
    "- Self-driving cars.\n",
    "- Game-playing agents (like AlphaGo).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent → Takes action in environment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reward → Learns from feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deep Q Networks (DQN)\n",
    "- Q-Learning\n",
    "- Policy Gradient Methods\n",

    "## Basic Workflow of Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect Data – Use real-world datasets (like from Kaggle or `sklearn.datasets`)\n",
    "2. Prepare Data – Clean and preprocess using Pandas, NumPy\n",
    "3. Split Data – Training set and Testing set (usually 80%-20%)\n",
    "4. Choose a Model – Like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.\n",
    "5. Train the Model – Using the training data\n",
    "6. Evaluate the Model – Using the testing data\n",
    "7. Predict – Make predictions on new/unseen data\n",
